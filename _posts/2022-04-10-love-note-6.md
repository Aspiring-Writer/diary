Good morning my queen,

I'm not sure, why I'm saying this. But the shower sorta made my stomach ease up some 😘

But that's not what this is for 🥺 I enjoyed tonight, we talked about a subject we haven't talked about in a long time, the Bible ❤️ I learned a lot from you tonight, and I plan on learning more 🥰 tonight was a great Bible chat, maybe somewhat of a Bible study. I can't wait to do that more with you here, I'd love to have my girl, pick titles out for me at times 💍 and just grow spiritually in God together. Tonight was such, a inspiration. We didn't get horny, well almost. But we kept it right on, the subject of the Bible. I'm so glad, I have you as mine 😍 I truly mean that. You keep me in line, your not afraid to state your opinion, but most of all we're on the same page 💍 your everything I prayed for, and I try to be everything that you want. I love talking to you, about anything and everything. Because, we get it 😊 I mentioned, that I only had a pastor I looked up too at Greater Rain. But I also have a girlfriend, I love and cherish so much, that I can look up to her too ❤️ thank you for letting me, help you, for being my girlfriend, and who God designed you to be. I love you, more than the earth beneath my feet. And I'll forever be grateful, and can't wait to further our lives together 😘

~ Your King 🥺👑💍 ~
