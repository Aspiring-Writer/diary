I was laying here, thinking about my blessings 🥺 and I just want you to know, you are one of many 😘 who I thought, I would never stand a chance with, God changed that around and put you in my life, and we're planning on getting married ❤️ sometimes we don't see, what's right in front of us, because we're to bound, by the things happening around us. But God is saying, if you want a blessing, I'll give you one, that'll change your life. And you have 😭 you have been such, a wonder girlfriend, soon to be fiance/wife 🥺 God just really restored everything, I let go of. And I'm praying, God will continue to bless you 😊 there for the longest time, I felt like one of those dry bones in Ezekiel's vision in Ezekiel 37. I was just needing someone to remind me, to rise up. And we have together. We've gotten stronger, encouraged, and we're in love. I don't know what I'd do without you, I know before we started talking here. Suicide crossed my mind. I didn't want to be here. Hurt and pain flooded my life. But right now, I'm blocking that out, with your love and affection, your encouragement, and compassion, and you being my bride 💍 blessings come in different ways, but mine came from one single message from twitch private chat, to messages in the discord, to us being here, from a gift and blessing from God 👑💍 I just know, I'm ready to spend Thanksgiving and Christmas with you 😘 and new years with my blessing and queen 👑

"Sometimes blessings, come right at the breaking point. Because, God has something great, to begin with that person he sends." @DrEncouragement from the title (Love & Blessings 2014)

I love you & God bless you my queen 😘💍
