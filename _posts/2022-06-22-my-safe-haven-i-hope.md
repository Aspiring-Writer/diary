Mama asked me if I ever thought about writing a book about me and Kota. I told her no and asked why.

Mama:\
Have you thought about writing a book about you and Kota?

Me:\
No, I've thought about a poem, but not a book. What gives you that idea?

Mama:\
Just some people love stories based on your life, and then it turns good

Me:\
Oh, I see\
Like a diary of sorts

Mama:\
Yeah, like start it out with how you struggled. Then eventually add were you met Kota, and you were happy. It'll sell, maybe even change some lives

Me:\
Could be a nice idea...
